## Created this repo to learn AngularJs
##### This is a work in progress and I will keep updating these as I learn new things.
A4app and Minimus are two different angular js apps.

Minimus is an app that shows weather and I followed [the tutorial @](https://medium.com/@hamedbaatour/build-a-real-world-beautiful-web-app-with-angular-6-a-to-z-ultimate-guide-2018-part-i-e121dd1d55e),
The tutrial is incomplete as I couldnt find the second part, but it is a great tutorial, do check it out.

###### What I need to implement?
 1. Add new city functionality.
 2. Login/logout
 3. SignUp
 4. Darkmode toggle.
 5. fixing styles of the details page.
 
 Thanks for reading this.
 
 have a good day :).
